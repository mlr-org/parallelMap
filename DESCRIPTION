Description: Unified parallelization framework for multiple
    back-end, designed for internal package and interactive usage.  The
    main operation is parallel mapping over lists.  Supports 'local',
    'multicore', 'mpi' and 'BatchJobs' mode.  Allows tagging of the
    parallel operation with a level name that can be later selected by the
    user to switch on parallel execution for exactly this operation.
